It is made to be both high level and fast. Julia is a fast dynamic-typed language that just-in-time &#40;JIT&#41; compiles into native code using LLVM.</p> <p>Julia uses the LLVM compiler, and yet is faster than many other languages, due to its language semantics which allows a well-written Julia program to give more opportunities to the compiler to generate efficient code and memory layouts.</p> <p>Julia has <strong>three</strong> main features that makes it a unique language to work with, specially in scientific computing:</p> <ul> <li><p>Speed</p> <li><p>Ease of Use</p> <li><p>Multiple Dispatch</p> </ul> <h3 id=speed ><a href="#speed" class=header-anchor >Speed </a></h3> <p>Julia is fast as it bypasses any sort of intermediate representation and translate code into machine native code using LLVM compiler. Comparing this with R, that uses either FORTRAN or C, or Python, that uses CPython; and you&#39;ll clearly see that Julia has a major speed advantage over other languages that are common in data science and statistics. Julia exposes the machine code to LLVM&#39;s compiler which in turn optimizes code as it wishes.</p> <h3 id=ease_of_use ><a href="#ease_of_use" class=header-anchor >Ease of Use</a></h3> <p>Julia can be as fast as C while having a very simple and intelligible syntax.</p> <p>This feature along with its speed is what Julia creators denote as &quot;the two language problem&quot; that Julia addresses. The &quot;two language problem&quot; is a very typical situation in scientific computing where a researcher or computer scientist devises an algorithm or a solution that she prototypes in an easy to code language &#40;like Python&#41; and, if it works she would code in a fast language that is not easy to code &#40;C or FORTRAN&#41;. </p> <p>Julia comes to eliminate such situations by being the same language that you prototype &#40;ease of use&#41; and implement the solution &#40;speed&#41;.</p> <p><strong>Math</strong>, julia code is closer to mathematical equations, as it lets us use unicode characters as variables or parameters. When you see code for an algorithm or for a mathematical equation you see <strong>a one-to-one relation to code and math</strong>. This is a powerful feature.</p> <h3 id=multiple_dispatach ><a href="#multiple_dispatach" class=header-anchor >Multiple Dispatach</a></h3> <p>The ability to define <strong>function behavior</strong> across many combinations of argument types via multiple dispatch. Multiple dispatch is a feature that allows a function or method to be dynamically dispatched based on the run-time &#40;dynamic&#41; type or, in the more general case, some other attribute of more than one of its arguments.</p> <p>Multiple dispatch empower users to define their own types &#40;if necessary&#41; and also allows them to extend functions and types from other users to their own special use.</p> <p>Attach video link</p> <p>Also, to cap it off, all julia libraries are written in julia, using it own code, without calling any other language.</p> <p>This part is taken from the excellent intro to julia from <a href="https://storopoli.io/Bayesian-Julia/pages/01_why_Julia/">Turing.jl website</a></p> <h2 id=understanding_fast_julia_code ><a href="#understanding_fast_julia_code" class=header-anchor >Understanding fast julia code</a></h2> <p>This part is taken from <a href="https://book.sciml.ai/notes/02-Optimizing_Serial_Code/">sciml lectures</a></p> <p>This part will explain what makes code slow and how to avoid these pitfalls. It will also go into the heart of julia and explain some key properties of the language.</p> <p>The 3 main points to keep in mind to write fast julia code is</p> <ol> <li><p>Use as few loops as possible</p> <li><p>Try to fuse as many loops as possible</p> <li><p>Reuse cache arrays as much as possible </p> </ol> <p>We will explore some important features of the Julia library to understand fast and compiler specific code:-</p> <h3 id=matrix_orientation ><a href="#matrix_orientation" class=header-anchor >Matrix Orientation</a></h3> <p>The processor works in a chain, so it before hand tries to guess which blocks of memory, we might be calling next. Thus our algorithms are faster if we grab memory along the cache line.

JIT compiler continuously analyses the code being executed and identifies parts of the code where the speedup gained from compilation or recompilation would outweigh the overhead of compiling that code. </p> <p>The jit compiler gets both the <strong>data type</strong>, and <strong>array size</strong>, &#40;object size&#41; of the code at the run time &#40;we have put the values&#41;, hense it compiles the code, its functions at the compile time based on this knowledge.

Hense, it knows the input and can identify the type of output &#40;for functions in functions&#41;, and it uses this to build a very efficient assembly code because it knows exactly what the types will be at every step.</p> <p>Multiple dispatch together with the flexible parametric type system give Julia its ability to abstractly express high-level algorithms decoupled from implementation details. As julia is always specializing its types on each function, if those functions themselves can infer the output, then the entire function can be inferred and generate optimal code, which is then optimized by the compiler and out comes an efficient function. If types can&#39;t be inferred, Julia falls back to a slower &quot;Python&quot; mode. </p> <p>Users get control over this specialization process through multiple dispatch, since it allows adding new options without any runtime cost.</p> <blockquote> <p>Julia basically decode the code during runtime, completing understanding and optimising all type and memory allocations.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id=type_inference ><a href="#type_inference" class=header-anchor >Type Inference</a></h3> <p>All data in a code has some data type and a program has to figure it out associate memory to it, carry out calculation, use it for functions.

This is a hybrid method solution, where we do not have to explicitly put types for functions like c&#43;&#43;. </p> <p>Also as jit compilation the data types are figured out, and due of type propagation of functions all variables, outputs data and sizes are known, reducing heap allocations and mutiple cache misses drastically.</p> <p><strong>Julia Code</strong>: </p> <pre><code class="julia hljs">a = <span class=hljs-number >2</span>; b = <span class=hljs-number >4</span>

<h3 id=multiple_dispatch ><a href="#multiple_dispatch" class=header-anchor >Multiple Dispatch</a></h3>
<p>In a nutshell, multiple dispatch is writing a function in different ways for different types of inputs for all function arguments.</p>
<p>A function is an object that maps a tuple of arguments to an output, and we need to have functions for different data type of arguments, or different objects. A definition of one possible behavior for a function is called a <strong>method</strong>. the signatures of method definitions can be annotated to indicate the types of arguments in addition to their number, and more than a single method definition may be provided to a function. Thus, the overall behavior of a function is a patchwork of the behaviors of its various method definitions. If the patchwork is well designed, even though the implementations of the methods may be quite different, the outward behavior of the function will appear seamless and consistent.</p>
<p>The choice of which method to execute when a function is applied is called <strong>dispatch</strong>. Julia allows the dispatch process to choose which of a function&#39;s methods to call based on the number of arguments given, and on the types of all of the function&#39;s arguments. This is different than traditional object-oriented languages, where dispatch occurs based only on the <strong>first argument</strong>, which often has a special argument syntax, and is sometimes implied rather than explicitly written as an argument. Using** all of a function&#39;s arguments** to choose which method should be invoked, rather than just the first, is known as multiple dispatch.</p>
<p>There isnt any general way to construct such functions in python, and in c&#43;&#43;, we have a similar thing as operator overloading &#40;also template programming&#41;, </p>

<pre><code class="julia hljs">f(x::<span class=hljs-built_in >Any</span>,y::<span class=hljs-built_in >Any</span>) = x+y</code></pre>

<p><strong>Ambiguities</strong></p>

<p>This powerful example shows how useful mutiple dispatch is to just make the function for an new type for some argument and it works.</p>
